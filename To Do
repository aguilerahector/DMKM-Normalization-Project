1. General idea and purpose about the project.(with diagram!)
2. Mention the objectives:
   2.a)Import of database schemes (metadata) from a database instance; if no database connection is available, relational schemes may be prompted manually
   2.b)Specification and editing of functional dependencies (FDs)
   2.c)Testing if a given set of FDs is satisfied in a database table (only if a database connection is available)
   2.d)Computation of a minimal cover
   2.e)Determination of the attribute closure for a given attribute set
   2.f)Calculation of all candidate keys
   2.g)Normal Form (NF) testing from 1NF up to BCNF; FDs which violate a certain NF are reported to the user
   2.h)Generation of a normalization proposal: synthesis of relations in 3NF is guaranteed; BCNF synthesis may be possible. Normalization includes computation of
   2.i)the new relations
   2.j)functional dependencies for the new relations
   2.k)all candidate keys for the new relations
   2.l)foreign key dependencies between the new relations
   2.m)normal forms of the new relations (3NF or BCNF)
   2.n)If a database connection is established, a SQL script for database transformation is created. This script includes
   2.o)DDL statements to create the new tables
   2.p)DML statements to migrate data from the old table to the new tables
   2.r)DDL statements to delete the old table
   2.s)DDL statements to add foreign key and constraints to the new tables
   2.t)DDL statements for view generation to ease the porting of existing database apllications
   2.u)Import and export of FDs and database schemes as XML files
   2.v)Import of FDs, automatically retrieved from a database
